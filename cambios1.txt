	git commit -m "this is the message"
committing with using the weird editor
	git add .    (the dot means adding all files in directory for the commit)
	git commit

			type i in order to actually write the message
			press ESC after finishing the message
			type :wq 
			enter - then the weird editor quits)
	git push
